AppEngineBoilerplate
====================

Cook up your new Google App Engine site fastah and bettah, with AppEngine Boilerplate.

We mix up a delicious blend of the tastiest web treats: HTML5 Boilerplate, Modernizr, Twitter Bootstrap, PJAX.js, socialite.js, and sticky footer for a fast and responsive front-end experience.

On the back end, a jinja2 wrapper trivialises template creation, and an authentication wrapper trivialises
user sign-in and Google Data API access.

It's all liberally sprinkled with smart caching to keep your site fast and your GAE costs down.
